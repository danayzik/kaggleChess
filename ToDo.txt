- Many mini neural networks for heuristic eval function based on combination of pieces left.
- Learn about MCTS, implement MCTS based on remaining material
- Implement a network that learns when to switch to MCTS

avoid using gameover in cpp


For botv2:
- hanging piece?
- Make weights so i can tune them later

- Add eval to visuals


AI:
- Genetic algo check


Eval function:
- get better square ratings
- Rook on king/queen row/column
- Bishop on king/queen diagonal
- Controlling squares
- how many it attacks
- how many it defends
- king safety
- Castling bonus
- pawn structure

- split via game stages

search:
- Order moves in minimax
-extensions
-Iterative
-Quiescence

Training:
- Get games database
- Train eval function



Visuals:
- Add Stockfish and our eval
- in bot vs bot, make moves increment in steps

- Check how agent code interacts with competition
- Export final bot to rust/C/C#
- Check memory and cpu restrictions
